# map-fuction

## What is map function ?

The map function requires an array and another function. It returns a new array which is the result of applying that function to all elements of the original array.

## How it works ?

In many programming languages, map is the name of a higher-order function that applies a given function to each element of a collection, e.g. a list or set, returning the results in a collection of the same type. It is often called apply-to-all when considered in functional form.
